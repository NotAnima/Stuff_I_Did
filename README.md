## ATM
Run the ATM.java to start

It will have to create a Bank, Person and Account before you can start doing anything.

The different object functions have yet to be tested

Have yet to add checking and savings class extension. Will have to discuss what "unique" functionality to implement first
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
